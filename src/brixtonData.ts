There is nothing to pay and you don't have to be a member of Streatham & Brixton Chess Club to participate. Strong players often drop by for a few games of blitz chess and several of our Tuesday afternoon regulars also play for our league teams. Members of the informal library chess group also have the opportunity to take part in more organized events, such as club rapidplays.",
